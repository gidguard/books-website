# books-website
Frontend code for a website that lets my friends pick which books they want from my books.

The full site is built on:
HTML-code for one page that displays a list of which books I have to give away.
A Google Sheet that contains the source information of the books I have to give away.
Python-code in the backend that handles the functions of reserving books, saving the reservations in a csv file, and making sure new people visiting the site can't reserve the same books already reserved.
A .CSV file with all the reservations that I can then use to send the books to my friends.
